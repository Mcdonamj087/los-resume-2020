# A Modern Resume Template

My good friend [Carlos Montoya](https://www.losmontoya.com/) designed this [resume](https://www.figma.com/community/file/826509588957755187) in Figma to help those who were struggling with layoffs and looking for new work. This resume template is open source and we encourage you to take it and do your own thing with it.  I will be working on a way to make it easily customizable, but until then, it's all static.


**Features**

- Built with CSS Grid
- Comes with a triggerable DARK MODE!
- Sass variables for easy template theming
