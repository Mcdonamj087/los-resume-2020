# A Modern Resume Template

My good friend Carlos Montoya designed this resume to help those who were struggling with layoffs and looking for new work. This resume template is open source and we encourage you to take it and do your own thing with it.

**Features**

- Built with CSS Grid
- Sass variables for easy template theming
